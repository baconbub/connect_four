Connect Four with adjustable board sizes and easy/hard modes.

Board size adjusted with command-line args: --height # --width #
Defaults to height: 6 width: 7

Hard mode algorithm currently has a depth limit of 3 to prevent lag.
In the constants, you can adjust it to search deeper, but to keep gameplay smooth I'd recommend keeping it at 3.
